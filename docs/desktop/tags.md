2. Select the __Tags__ types for which an alternative description will be generated, separated by commas.
3. Check the __Exclude__ option if processing is required for tags other than the specified ones.
4. Define a source for detecting the alternative text in __Alternative Text__ combobox.
    - __Define the Custom Alternative text__
      - Fill the custom text into the Alternative Text edit. This text will be used for all selected tags as the annotation Alt key.
    - __Use the first Description Tag above__
      - Fill Description Tag type. PDFix finds the nearest tag of this type above the processing one and utilizes its content as an alternative description for processing tags.
    - __Use the first Description Tag below__
      - Fill Description Tag type. PDFix finds the nearest tag of this type __below__ the processing one and utilizes its content as an alternative description for processing tags.
    - __Use the first Description Tag from children__
      - Fill __Description Tag__ type. PDFix finds the first tag from the processing tagâ€™s children and utilizes its content as an alternative description for processing tags.
    - __Use the associated tag content__
      - PDFix gathers all text content from the children of the processing tag. If there is an Annotation among the children, its __Contents__ key is utilized.
5. Check Overwrite if an existing alternative description needs to be replaced.
6. Run Command Set Alternate Description.

If you want to assign an alternative description of annotations to the Alt key instead of the Contents key, you can use this command for annotation tags. Afterwards, you can clean the Contents key of these annotations with setting __Set Contents->Define the Custom Contents text->Custom Contents__ to empty.
